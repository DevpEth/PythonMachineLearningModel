# PythonMachineLearningModel

Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict student performance using a dataset with over 5,000 records.
Cleaned data using Pandas and NumPy, trained and evaluated the model using Scikit-learn.
Currently implementing interactive data visualizations of prediction results with Dash and Flask.
